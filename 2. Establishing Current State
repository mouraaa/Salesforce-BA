Establishing Current State: 
——————————————————————————————————————————
What is current state?

When trying to improve company systems, processes and workflows, you need to know the current state to identify areas of improvement to increase overall productivity and efficiency.

Once you find do your analysis, you can create user stories to track and your work of updating current state to future state

There are multiple ways of analyzing the current state (https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/current-state-analysis)
	1. conducting research
	2. interview professionals
	3. observations through following a person's day to day
	4. surveys

You would then document the process and identify any gaps, obstacles or flaws.

There are multiple ways of establishing current state for different areas in salesforce outside the 4 ways listed above
Some of these are packaged that were downloaded form the app exchange
